    <h3>How I started my coding journey:</h3>
    <p>I started my coding journey a little over a year ago. I started learning Python then but I wanted to switch to
        web. I began this journey but found it hard to make reliable progress on my own. I heard about EFA and I wanted
        to check it out.</p>
    <br />
    <p>My life has changed the last year. I did many things to get where I am at with EFA.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I left my Operations management job at Kroger Co.</li>
        <li>I was unemployed for a couple months while looking for a job.</li>
        <li>I got a job at Northwind Pharmaceuticals</li>
        <li>I now am leaving my job and doing EFA to get a coding job</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>Here is a link to the company <a href="https://www.nwpharma.com/" target="_blank">Northwind Pharmaceuticals</a>
        that I work at now.</p>
